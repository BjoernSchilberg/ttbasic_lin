## Difference to grammer from PALO ALTO TinyBASIC by Li-Chen Wang

The grammar is the same as
PALO ALTO TinyBASIC by Li-Chen Wang
Except 4 point to show below.

1. The contracted form of the description is invalid.

2. Force abort key
- PALO ALTO TinyBASIC -> `Ctrl+C`
- TOYOSHIKI TinyBASIC -> `ESC`

3. SYSTEM command
- SYSTEM return to Linux.

4. Other some beyond my expectations.
